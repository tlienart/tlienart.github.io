# Welcome

On this website, you will mainly find some notes on topics in computer science and machine learning (CS/ML) as well as, more generally, applied maths.
I also really like the Julia programming language and keep some notes on that too.

Finally, there are a number of miscellaneous posts in other topics ranging from philosophy to travelling.
For instance, if you're interested in knowing how this website was made, there's a [post for that](/pub/misc/judoc.html) where I explain how the static site generator I built works.

## News

If you would like to be updated when new sets of notes appear, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/t_lienart).
