# My website

This repository contains the source files behind [my website](https://tlienart.github.io) as well as the issues for comments / questions.

**Note** (October 2018): this is _ongoing work_ along with the [JuDoc.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/JuDoc.jl) package (a static site generator I built for this purpose). I'm basically porting (and fixing) all the content from my old website to this which will take me some time but should hopefully be done by the end of November.

### Random notes

* KaTeX: careful with updating as it may mess up things like numbering or not-equal sign, version here seems to work fine.
