# Julia notes

## Projects

* [PDSampler](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/PDSampler.jl), a package I wrote for *piecewise deterministic samplers*.
* [JuDoc](https://github.com/tlienart/JuDoc.jl), an experimental static site generator (SSG) which I used for this website.
* [EPBP](https://github.com/tlienart/EPBP.jl), a package accompanying my paper on [_expected particle belief propagation_](/assets/misc/pdf/epbp.pdf), it hasn't been maintained in a while.
