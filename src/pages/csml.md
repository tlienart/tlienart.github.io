# Computer science & machine learning notes

The aim of the notes you'll find here is to suggest a constructive path to results I find useful, beautiful, or just interesting.

The emphasis is on building intuition rather than mathematical rigour.
The target audience is advanced undergrads or grads in quantitative fields such as applied-maths, comp-sci, etc, assuming a decent background in mathematics.

If you find anything dubious in the notes, please send me an email.

## Stats, ML and related

* *notes on variational inference*
* *notes on RKHS embeddings*

## Applied maths

* *notes on convex optimisation* <!-- ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš« 12/9/18 -->
    * [introduction](/pub/csml/cvx_opti/intro.html): where the general minimisation problem is mentioned as well as a hint for generic iterative methods. <!-- âœ… 12/9/18 -->
    * [convex analysis part 1](/pub/csml/cvx_opti/ca_1.html): where some elementary notions of convex analysis are introduced: the *subgradient* and the *first-order optimality condition*. <!-- âœ… 12/9/18 -->
    * [convex analysis part 2](/pub/csml/cvx_opti/ca_2.html): where the *convex conjugate* is introduced with some of its properties. <!-- âœ… 12/9/18 -->
    * [convex analysis part 3](/pub/csml/cvx_opti/ca_3.html): where more notions of convex analysis are introduced, these are more the type of results which would be useful to elucidate proofs and so can easily be skipped in a first pass. <!-- ðŸš« 12/9/18 -->
* *notes on Krylov subspace methods*
