<h1>Miscellaneous notes</h1>
<p>Here I keep a record of pages I wrote which do not deserve their own category &#40;at least for now&#41;.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/pub/misc/about-website.html">about this website</a>: where I discuss how this website was built.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Travels</h2>
<p>TODO: think about a format for this. Probably best to stick to the actual useful stuff rather than a blog-style thing. Maybe add small intro saying these are mostly a list of tips that may be useful</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>short notes of a trip to Iran</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>short notes of a trip to Colombia</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>money in Colombia &#40;no credit card, at least not often, withdrawing cash is a bit annoying but probably best not carrying a ton of notes with you&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>haggling &#40;people mostly honest, this is true even with taxi drivers surprisingly, though bear in mind that in some places there&#39;s a fixed price &#40;best to ask locals for a ballpark&#41; whereas in others &#40;such as Cali, Medellin&#41; people put the taximetro, and if they forget you can remind them at the start and they&#39;ll do it without problem&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>speaking &#40;people very easy to talk to, but speak in spanish&#33; even if it&#39;s horrible people will enthusiastically start talking to you, you won&#39;t get far with english&#41;, people are extremely friendly and welcoming, so don&#39;t hesitate engaging the conversation, you&#39;ll get a lot from those even if your spanish is basic, we definitely did&#33;</p>
</li>
<li><p>malaria? depends on the country you&#39;re from, we took it, some people didn&#39;t</p>
</li>
<li><p>ciudad perdida, great walk, fantastic view, unfortunately everything is done in groups, this can be annoying because even if the group you join is small you will see other groups while walking &#40;especially if you walk faster/slower than your group&#41;. This can be a bit annoying as there&#39;s a bit of a feeling of a &quot;human train&quot; going up/down the sierra nevada. Still, it&#39;s good fun and we&#39;d recommend doing it. It&#39;s quite easy if you&#39;re in a reasonable state of fitness so 4 days is more than enough to do it. In fact you could do it in 2 days of hard walking but that just wouldn&#39;t work with the organisation of the tours there &#40;and I don&#39;t believe you can do the walk without a tour&#41;. We did Wiwa tour and were happy with it, I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a huge differentiation factor apart from the fact that our tour guide was indigenous, friendly, and full of interesting information. That being said from what we could see, other tours were similar in size and format.</p>
</li>
<li><p>security? ask locals, we didn&#39;t feel unsafe anywhere apart from on a hill in Cali where we weren&#39;t supposed to go &#40;we climbed the wrong one&#41; but even there nothing happened, and we were just cautious because there were few people around</p>
</li>
<li><p>cycling, loads of fun, polluted, hard to get by a road bike, possible to rent MTB but can be of crappy conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>taxi in Cartagena: everything is fixed price &#40;ask before you enter the taxi to check if they&#39;re trying to rip you off, doesn&#39;t happen much in colombia but if it does, it likely will be in cartaghena which is plagued with clueless tourists, I think ~6000 for inner-city trips, uber is pretty cheap too, technically it doesn&#39;t work but...&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>uber in Colombia, works well, though not necessarily cheaper than taxi, also illegal so from the airport I&#39;d suggest just getting a taxi</p>
</li>
<li><p>food in Colombia, we like to eat in random local places the locals seem to go to but doing so we were usually quite disappointed. The best food we&#39;ve had in Colombia was in Cartagena in a fusion Lebanese-Carribean restaurant but definitely not really the kind of stuff locals go to. Pizza is probably the next best thing. Otherwise, be ready for unimpressive food, especially if you&#39;re vegetarian &#40;and even if you aren&#39;t&#41;. Eggs and rice is probably the best thing you&#39;ll eat over there :-&#41; &#40;yes it&#39;s that bad&#41;. That being said, the fruits are absolutely mind blowing. So gorge yourself on fresh fruits, quench your thirst with fresh fruit juice, eat fresh fruit gelato in Cali etc etc. It will never disappoint. You may also eat fruits you have never seen in your life &#40;we did&#41;, just give it a shot, it&#39;s usually very good.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>short notes of a &#40;short&#41; trip to Chile</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>speaking, spanish, though watch out, even if you speak decent spanish you may really struggle to understand what people try to tell you &#40;especially in taxis&#41;, ask people to slow down and apologise, it doesn&#39;t always work though ...</p>
</li>
<li><p>atacama: do rent a car, everything is far, being stuck in a minibus with a group where people get told when to get off and when to get back on would completely change your experience of what the atacama is about: a big desert with no one around, calmness, desolation, superb. Spend at least 4 full days there.</p>
</li>
<li><p>food in Chile: we may have gotten particularly unlucky with the food but we were really not impressed anywhere we went which is unfortunate but gets kind of funny after a while. If you&#39;re a bit of a foodie, consider doing your research or being thoroughly disappointed. This is in SPDA just as much as in Santiago and Valparaiso.</p>
</li>
<li><p>uber in santiago: very easy although illegal. Would recommend for traveling around santiago or TO the airport, would NOT recommend to go FROM the airport as it&#39;s quite hairy to know exactly where the uber wants to pick you up &#40;since they want to avoid the police&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>santiago airport to valparaiso: ask for the bus to people, it&#39;s super easy, you have to change after 20 minutes in a suburb of santiago and from there take a bus to valparaiso which is cheap and comfortable</p>
</li>
<li><p>valparaiso: very nice, well worth walking idly, to get a feel for the city&#39;s soul, lots of graffiti on the wall, some very interesting, going up to see the nice view on the city in the evening is an absolute must</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>short notes of a &#40;short&#41; trip to Sri Lanka</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>don&#39;t withdraw too much money, everything is super cheap especially if you stay off the beaten  touristic track: do go in the country side, it&#39;s absolutely stunning, lush and fun, I would recommend trying to get bikes &#40;MTB&#41; through your hosts, 10 USD a day should be about right to get decent, serviced MTB, more and you&#39;re getting ripped off.</p>
</li>
<li><p>tuk tuk within Kandy &#40;10 min trip&#41; &lt;&#61; 200 RS</p>
</li>
<li><p>bus from Airport to Kandy &#40;3h&#41; &lt;&#61; 200 RS per person &#40;epic ride, ideally befriend your neighbour to know where to get off&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>clothes you can buy in local market &lt;&#61; 500 RS per piece &#40;yes really, haggle&#33;&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>hand sanitizer in a pharmacy &lt;&#61; 250 RS</p>
</li>
<li><p>tea in a tea factory &lt;&#61; 1000 RS for 250g of top quality loose leaf black tea,</p>
</li>
<li><p>SIM card at the airport, 3Go of data &#40;very convenient&#41; we paid 10USD in the airport, could probably have paid less outside but didn&#39;t want the hassle</p>
</li>
