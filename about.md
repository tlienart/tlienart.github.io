# Bio

I've been working at Amazon as a ML scientist since early 2020, first as part of
[AWS SageMaker Autopilot team](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/autopilot/) (an Auto-ML service),
and currently as part of ATS Europe (forecasting and logistics).

Before that, I worked as a freelance ML engineer on a number of projects including [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl), an ML for Julia open-source project.
I also did a postdoc with [Ben Rubinstein](http://www.bipr.net/) at the University
of Melbourne working on adversarial learning, and one with [Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk) at the Imperial College London working on applications of ML in privacy.

My DPhil was in computational Bayesian ML; I was part of the [Oxford CSML group](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/), co-supervised by
[Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and [Yee-Whye Teh](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/).


## Julia

I enjoy coding in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and maintain(ed) / help(ed) maintain a few packages, notably:

* [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), a hackable static site generator used for a number of Julia websites including <https://julialang.org> and <https://juliacon.org>,
* [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl), a ML toolbox project for Julia led by [Anthony Blaom](https://ablaom.github.io).

I also maintain(ed) or help(ed) maintain a bunch of related packages: [LiveServer.jl](http://github.com/asprionj/LiveServer.jl), [PkgPage.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/PkgPage.jl), [MLJLinearModels.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJLinearModels.jl),  [DataScienceTutorials.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/DataScienceTutorials.jl), etc. as well as a few others accompanying past research projects: [PDSampler.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/PDSampler.jl) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04244)), [EPBP.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/EPBP.jl) ([paper](https://tlienart.github.io/assets/misc/pdf/epbp.pdf)), and [PosteriorServer.jl](https://github.com/BigBayes/PosteriorServer) ([paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-478/16-478.pdf)).
