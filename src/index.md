# Welcome

**THIS WEBSITE IS CURRENTLY A DRAFT**

On this website, you will find some notes on topics in applied maths	(including optimisation, machine learning etc), focusing on core ideas rather than rigorous proofs.

The aim of this website is to suggest a constructive path to results I	find useful, beautiful, or just interesting.
The emphasis is on building intuition rather than mathematical rigour.
The target audience is advanced undergrads or grads in quantitative fields such as applied-maths, comp-sci, etc, assuming a decent background in mathematics.

If you happen to see a dubious statement, a mistake or would like to make a suggestion, each page has its GitHub issue.
