# Website

This repository contains the source files leading to the website as well as the issues for comments / questions.

**Note** (June 2018): this is ongoing work along with the [JuDoc.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/JuDoc.jl) package, while it will eventually become my website, at the moment it's more of a testing ground (the html is generated through JuDoc). 

## Todo

### CA1

* [ ] check comments in src
* [ ] where is `Gamma_0` defined?
* [ ] deal with numbering
* [ ] proof-read

### CA2

* [ ] add eq-references if possible
* [ ] add a bit of space above h2 titles
