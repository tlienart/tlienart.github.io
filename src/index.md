# Welcome

On this website, you will find some notes I keep on topics in computer science and machine learning (CS/ML).
These are mostly notes I write to keep track of results I find useful or nice (or both).

## News

If you would like to be updated when new sets of notes appear, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/t_lienart).

    I&#39;m, currently a freelance machine learning engineer working primarily for the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl">ML for Julia</a> project (MLJ).

    Previously I was a postdoc in adversarial ML at the University of Melbourne in <a href="http://www.bipr.net/">Ben Rubinstein</a>&#39;s group and before that in <a href="http://demontjoye.com/">Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye</a>&#39;s <a href="https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/">computational privacy group</a> at Imperial College.

    I received my PhD from Oxford in Bayesian ML. I was part of the <a href="http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/">OxCSML group</a>, co-supervised by <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/">Arnaud Doucet</a> and <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/">Yee-Whye Teh</a>.
