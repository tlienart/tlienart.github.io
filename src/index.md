# Welcome

On this website, you will mainly find some notes on topics in computer science and machine learning (CS/ML) and some in applied maths.
These are mostly things I write to keep track of results I find useful or nice.
I also really like the Julia programming language and keep some notes on that too.

🚫 Please bear in mind that as of October-November 2018, this site is being migrated from a previous site so quite a few pages are yet to appear!

<!-- Then, there's a number of miscellaneous posts in other topics ranging from  travel notes to side-projects.
For example if you're interested in knowing how this website was built, there's a [post for that](/pub/misc/about-website.html).-->

## News

If you would like to be updated when new sets of notes appear, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/t_lienart).
