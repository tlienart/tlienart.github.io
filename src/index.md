# Welcome

On this website, you will mainly find some notes on topics in computer science and machine learning (CS/ML) and some in applied maths.
These are mostly things I write to keep track of results I find useful or nice.
I also really like the Julia programming language and keep some notes on that too.

## News

If you would like to be updated when new sets of notes appear, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/t_lienart).

    I&#39;m Thibaut Lienart, currently a postdoc in adversarial ML at the University of Melbourne in <a href="http://www.bipr.net/">Ben Rubinstein</a>&#39;s group.
    Prior to that I was a postdoc in computational privacy at Imperial College London in <a href="http://demontjoye.com/">Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye</a>&#39;s <a href="https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/">group</a>.
    I got my PhD from Oxford in Bayesian ML co-supervised by <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/">Arnaud Doucet</a> and <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/">Yee-Whye Teh</a>.
