# My website

This repository contains the source files behind [my website](https://tlienart.github.io) as well as the issues for comments / questions.

**Note** (October 2018): this is _ongoing work_ along with the [JuDoc.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/JuDoc.jl) package (a static site generator I built for this purpose). I'm basically porting (and fixing) all the content from my old website to this which will take me some time but should hopefully be done by the end of November.

### Random notes

* KaTeX: using `0.10.0` (latest currently), note:
    * `.katex-display > .katex { display : inline-block;}` and not `display:block` (see [issue](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/1785))

## Todo list

Stuff that should end up on the website at some point

**CSML/cvxopt**
* further on MDA, showing that MDA and natural gradient connect, just show that locally Bregman div are just A-norms and then you're in the natural world

**CSML/sampling**
* filtering etc, from kalman to SMC, smoothing and co + some code

**CSML/ep-vb**
* the whole lot from the thesis

**Julia**
* package exploration, just write short articles where you look at a package that's cool
