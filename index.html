<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>On this website, you will find some notes on topics in applied maths	&#40;including optimisation, machine learning etc&#41;, focusing on core ideas rather than rigorous proofs.</p>
<p>The aim of this website is to suggest a constructive path to results I	find useful, beautiful, or just interesting. The emphasis is on building intuition rather than mathematical rigour. The target audience is advanced undergrads or grads in quantitative fields such as applied-maths, comp-sci, etc, assuming a decent background in mathematics.</p>
<p>If you happen to see a dubious statement, a mistake or would like to make a suggestion, each page has its GitHub issue.</p>
