# Computer science & machine learning notes

The aim of the notes you'll find here is to suggest a constructive path to results I find useful, beautiful, or just interesting.

The emphasis is on building intuition rather than mathematical rigour.
The target audience is advanced undergrads or grads in quantitative fields such as applied-maths, comp-sci, etc, assuming a decent background in mathematics.

If you find anything dubious in the notes, please send me an email.
