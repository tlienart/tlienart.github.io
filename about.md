# Bio

I've been working at Amazon as a machine learning (ML) scientist since 2020, first as part of
[AWS SageMaker Autopilot team](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/autopilot/) (an Auto-ML product),
and currently as part of Amazon Transportation Services Europe (logistics and forecasting).

Before that, I worked as a freelance ML engineer, mainly working on the ML for Julia
[MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl) open-source project sponsored by the
[Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).
Prior to that, I was a postdoc in [Ben Rubinstein's group](http://www.bipr.net/) group at the University
of Melbourne working on adversarial learning, after a stint as a postdoc in [Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye's group](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk) computational privacy group at the Imperial College
London.

I obtained my DPhil in Statistics from Oxford in 2018 where I was part of the
[OxCSML group](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/), co-supervised by
[Arnaud Doucet](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) and
[Yee-Whye Teh](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/).
My research there focused on computational methods for Bayesian ML.

## Julia

I'm fond of the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language and maintain(ed) / help(ed)
maintain a few packages with the main ones being:

* [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), a hackable static site generator. Franklin is used for quite a few Julia sites including <https://julialang.org> and <https://juliacon.org>,
* [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl), a ML toolbox for Julia, a project led by [Anthony Blaom](https://ablaom.github.io) and sponsored by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk).

I also maintain(ed) or help(ed) maintain a bunch of related packages: [LiveServer.jl](http://github.com/asprionj/LiveServer.jl), [PkgPage.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/PkgPage.jl), [MLJLinearModels.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJLinearModels.jl),  [DataScienceTutorials.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/DataScienceTutorials.jl),... as well as a few packages accompanying past research projects: [PDSampler.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/PDSampler.jl) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04244)), [EPBP.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/EPBP.jl) ([paper](https://tlienart.github.io/assets/misc/pdf/epbp.pdf)), and [PosteriorServer.jl](https://github.com/BigBayes/PosteriorServer) ([paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-478/16-478.pdf)).
